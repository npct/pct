Part of Phase III of the Propensity to Cycle Tool project, awarded to the team by the Department for Transport to add new features, was to ensure the routing data remained up-to-date.
In March we launched the School Travel layer, which provides insight into routes with the most cycling potential to inform investment and policies to reduce air pollution and increase activity levels among children nationwide.
This post is to announce the launch of another new dataset, that is more subtle but perhaps equally important as the School Travel layer: updated route data for the commuting layer in the PCT, and another scenario.

## Why update the routes?

The quickest way to get from A to B is generally static over time, so it may be a surprise that we prioritised updating the route data.
However, the cycle network in many cities is evolving.
This is generally a good thing: new cycle infrastructure can reduce journey distances and the PCT should be based on the latest data.
A new bridge, for example, could lead part of a network to shift such that investment in 'feeder routes' is necessary to create a cohesive cycle network.

[Example of bridge?]

Another reason to update the route data is that OpenStreetMap data underlying the routes generated by CycleStreets.net is constantly evolving.
New contributors add to and improve the data all the time, making the routes generated more realistic over time.

For these reasons over the last few months we've been preparing an update to the commute layer.
The results may be slightly different in some places, for example, if the fast route along a particular desire line becomes shorter, the estimated levels of cycling uptake will increase slightly, reflecting the fact that people are more likely to cycle short distances (assuming there is good infrastructure).

A final reason for updating the routes is that we wanted to improve the route network data.

## Updated route network data

Initially, the PCT was based exclusively on data at the MSOA level, each of which is inhabited by around 7000 people.
The 'vector route network' layer is based on this input data and was initially the only route network layer available.
In early 2017, however, we expanded the PCT data to include data representing trips between LSOAs, each of which homes around 3000, as outlined in the blog article [Lower Level Super Output Area route network now up!](https://blog.pct.bike/2017/03/21/lower-level-super-output-area-route-network-now-up/).

Due to computational constraints, we only provided the route network representation of these new 'LSOA routes' as a raster image.
The clickable vector layer remained the same, based on the MSOA route data.
Thanks to development work by in the R package **stplanr**, the computational constraints preventing us from building route networks on the larger LSOA routes no longer apply.^[
This is thanks to the new function [`overline2()`](https://ropensci.github.io/stplanr/reference/overline2.html), which is 2 orders of magnitude (100+ fold) faster than its predecessor `overline()`.
]
We have therefore decided to replace the MSOA route network layer with an LSOA route network layer generated by the open source software **stplanr**.
The results show the benefits: the figure below, for example, shows the before and after route networks in Hereford and Worcester.
