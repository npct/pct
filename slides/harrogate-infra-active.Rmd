## Policy feedback

"The PCT is a brilliant example of using Big Data to better plan infrastructure investment. It will allow us to have more confidence that new schemes are built in places and along travel corridors where there is high latent demand."

- Shane Snow: Head of Seamless Travel Team, Sustainable and Acessible Travel Division

"The PCT shows the country’s great potential to get on their bikes, highlights the areas of highest possible growth and will be a useful innovation for local authorities to get the greatest bang for their buck from cycling investments  and realise cycling potential."

- Andrew Jones, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport

## The PCT in CWIS and LCWIP

Included in Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Strategy (CWIS) and the Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan (LCWIP)

```

## How the PCT works

Shows on the map where there is high cycling potential,
for 4 scenarios of change

- Government Target
- Gender Equality
- Go Dutch
- Ebikes

## Scenario shift in desire lines | Source: @lovelace_propensity_2017

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/robin/h/npct/pct-teamflow-model/od-data-leeds.png")
```

- Origin-destination data shows 'desire lines'
- How will these shift with cycling uptake

## Scenario shift in network load

## Research into impacts of roads

The extension of the M74 motorway = 'natural experiment':

- People who live near motorways seem to be less physically active [@ogilvie_evaluating_2006]
- And more car dependent [@prins_effects_2017]
    - Although no evidence of impacts on active travel

## Research into impacts of roads II

A recent review of impact assessment methods in the English context found that an increasingly wide range of methods and approaches were being used  [@tajima_should_2013]:

- Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
- Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)
- Health Impact Assessment (HIA)
- Gender Impact Assessment (GIA)
- Equality Impact Assessment (EqIA)

- But overall not a huge amount of research in the area, particularly in relation to the impact on active travel:

> - "there is very little empirical data on the impact of road transport interventions", aside from injury reduction estimates [@thomson_assessing_2008]


## Active travel impacts: a typology

## Cycling potential parallel to the route

3 stage methodology to identify parallel lines:

> - Subset desire lines whose cetrepoints are far from the proposed route
> - Segment the proposed route
> - Calculate the angle of each route

Then keep only lines parallel to proposed route segments

```{r gendata, echo=FALSE}
l_cp = geo_projected(l_lc, fun = maptools::SpatialLinesMidPoints)
sel_centrepoint = rgeos::gContains(buff, l_cp, byid = T)[,1]

# Line bearing code
l_a = line_bearing(lewes_uckfield)
a = angle_diff(l = l_lc, angle = l_a, bidirectional = TRUE)
sel_para = a < 30

# Parallel subsetting
buff7 = buff_geo(lewes_uckfield, width = 5000)
buff_small = buff_geo(lewes_uckfield, width = 2000)
sel_centrepoint5 = rgeos::gContains(buff7, l_cp, byid = T)[,1]
sel_smallbuff = !is.na(over(l_lc, buff_small))
sel_finalpar = sel_para & sel_centrepoint5 & sel_smallbuff
l_lc$`Parallel selection` = sel_finalpar
l_lc$`Touching buffer` = TRUE

# Perpendicular lines
# l_seg = line_segment(lewes_uckfield, segment_length = 1000)
# saveRDS(l_seg, "data-sources/l_seg.Rds")
l_seg = readRDS("../data-sources/l_seg.Rds")
l_lc$Perpendicular = a > 60
sel_intersects = over(l_lc, l_seg)
l_lc$`Perpendicular selection` = !is.na(sel_intersects[,1]) & a > 60
l_agg = aggregate(l_lc["govtarget_slc"], l_seg, FUN = sum)
```

## Subsetting desire lines by centre point proximity

```{r centre points, fig.cap="Illustration of the 'line centre point' subsetting method."}
buff = SpatialPolygonsDataFrame(Sr = buff, data = data.frame(n = 1), match.ID = F)
tm_shape(l_lc) + tm_lines(col = "grey", lwd = 3) +
tm_shape(buff) + tm_fill(col = "blue", alpha = 0.3) +
  tm_shape(lewes_uckfield) + tm_lines(lwd = 5, col = "black") +
  tm_shape(l_cp) + tm_dots() +
  tm_shape(l_lc[sel_centrepoint,]) + tm_lines() 
```

## Finding desire lines that are (roughly) parallel

This involved the development of a new R function:

```{r}
a = angle_diff(l = l_lc, angle = l_a, bidirectional = TRUE)
sel_para = a < 30
qtm(l_lc, lines.col = "grey") +
  qtm(l_lc[sel_para,]) +
  qtm(lewes_uckfield, lines.lwd = 4, lines.col = "black") 
```

## The angle_diff function

From the R package **stplanr**

```{r}
angle_diff
```

## What about perpendicular lines (severance)?

The same method!

```{r}
l_lc$Perpendicular = a > 60
qtm(l_lc, lines.col = "grey") +
  qtm(l_lc[l_lc$Perpendicular,]) +
  qtm(lewes_uckfield, lines.lwd = 4, lines.col = "black") 
```

## 3: Access to stations (Credit: M. Morgan)

> - Divide each route into 3

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../infra-active/stations.png")
```


## How to deal with long, windy routes?

> - Break the train line into segments

```{r segs, fig.cap="Method of splitting the route into discrete segments using the line segment function from the stplanr R package (a) and cycling potential severed (b).", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/route-sel.png")
```

## All methods together

```{r metafigure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Centre point-buffer (a), parallel (b), perpendicular (c) and station access (d) methods.", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/infra-selection-all.png")
```

# Results and discussion

## Cycling opportunities and threats

```{r, echo=FALSE}
res = readRDS("../input-data/res.Rds")
res_stations = readRDS("../input-data/res_stns.Rds")
# sel_res = grepl(pattern = "11|Gov", rownames(res))
# res_sub = res[sel_res,]
res_sub = rbind(res[1:3,], res_stations[1,], res[4:6,], res_stations[2,])
names_scens = c(gsub(pattern = "Census 2011: ", replacement = "", row.names(res_sub[1:3,])),
                "Cycling to stations")
names_scens = c("Baseline", names_scens, "Scenario", names_scens)
res_sub[2:4] = apply(res_sub[2:4], 2, round, 1)
empty_string = rep("", ncol(res_sub))
res_sub = rbind(empty_string, res_sub[1:4,], empty_string, res_sub[5:8,])
res_sub = cbind(Scenario = names_scens, res_sub)
knitr::kable(res_sub, digits = 1, row.names = F)
```


## Final question

- How to integrate this work in existing tools?
- How to ensure maximum policy impact?
- How reproducibility can help?
